# Speech Recognition Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Package Installation
- ✅ Installed `expo-speech-recognition` for speech recognition capabilities
- ✅ Installed `expo-dev-client` for custom development builds

### 2. Configuration
- ✅ Updated `app.json` with:
  - iOS permissions for microphone and speech recognition
  - Plugin configuration for expo-speech-recognition
  - Plugin configuration for expo-dev-client
- ✅ Created `eas.json` for build profiles (development and development-simulator)
- ✅ Added build scripts to `package.json`

### 3. Speech Recognition Wrapper (`lib/speech-recognition.ts`)
Created a fully-typed wrapper with:
- ✅ Enumerated states using const objects (`RecognitionState`)
- ✅ Typed variables (transcript, recognizing, etc.)
- ✅ Exposed methods (start, stop, abort, reset)
- ✅ Configuration settings:
  - `interimResults: true` - Live transcription enabled
  - `continuous: true` - Continuous recognition mode
  - `requiresOnDeviceRecognition: false` - Using network-based recognition
  - `addsPunctuation: false` - No automatic punctuation
  - `iosTaskHint: "dictation"` - Optimized for dictation
  - iOS audio category configured for background recording
  - Contextual strings from the codebase for better recognition
  - Recording persistence enabled

### 4. Demo Screen (`app/index.tsx`)
Replaced home screen with comprehensive demo featuring:
- ✅ Device capabilities display
- ✅ Real-time status indicator with visual feedback
- ✅ Control buttons (Start, Stop, Abort, Reset)
- ✅ Live transcript display with interim results
- ✅ Error handling and display
- ✅ Recording file path display
- ✅ Active features showcase
- ✅ Professional UI with proper styling

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created `addspeech.plan.md` with implementation plan
- ✅ Created `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with:
  - When to rebuild (quoted from Expo docs)
  - Build commands for simulator and device
  - Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Added iOS-only rule to `.roo/rules/`

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Speech Recognition Features
1. **Live Transcription** - Real-time interim results as you speak
2. **Continuous Mode** - Keeps listening until manually stopped
3. **Network-Based** - Uses Apple's speech recognition servers
4. **Audio Recording** - Persists audio files locally
5. **Dictation Mode** - Optimized for dictation use case
6. **Background Audio** - Works with speakers/headphones
7. **Contextual Awareness** - Uses project-specific vocabulary

### UI Features
1. **Status Visualization** - Color-coded states with emojis
2. **Capability Check** - Shows device support status
3. **Live Feedback** - Separate display for final and interim text
4. **Error Display** - Clear error messages
5. **Recording Info** - Shows saved audio file path
6. **Feature Grid** - Visual confirmation of active features

## 📱 Next Steps to Use

### For Development

1. **Build the development client** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   
   # For iOS Simulator
   npm run build:ios:simulator
   
   # For iOS Device (requires Apple Developer account)
   npm run build:ios
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in simulator/device**:
   - Press `i` in the terminal to open iOS simulator
   - Or scan QR code with device that has development build installed

### Important Notes

- **iOS Only**: This implementation is iOS-specific per project requirements
- **Rebuild Required**: You must create a new build after adding expo-speech-recognition
- **Permissions**: The app will request microphone permissions on first use
- **Network Required**: Uses network-based recognition (not on-device)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support with proper typing
- Enumerated states prevent invalid state values
- Typed event handlers and results

### State Management
- Clean state machine with defined transitions
- Separate tracking for final and interim transcripts
- Error state handling

### Performance
- Optimized for continuous listening
- Efficient event handling with React hooks
- Proper cleanup and resource management

## 📝 Quote from Expo Documentation

> "A development build is essentially your own version of Expo Go where you are free to use any native libraries and change any native config."

This is why we need to create a development build after adding expo-speech-recognition, as it includes native iOS code that isn't available in the standard Expo Go app.
