What an amazing Saturday adventure! ðŸ¤©

Today was absolutely incredible with Alexa and little Wren! We started our day by heading out to run some errands, but it turned into such a fun family outing. First stop was dropping off a bunch of old clothes and household items at Goodwill - it felt so good to declutter and help others at the same time! ðŸ¤©

Wren was being his usual curious self, asking about everything we were donating and why we were giving it away. Alexa and I just looked at each other and smiled - these are the moments that make parenting so special.

Then we hit up the store for some groceries and essentials. Wren insisted on "helping" push the cart, which meant we zigzagged through every aisle, but his enthusiasm was contagious! ðŸ¤©

Our final stop was Lowe's, where we picked up some supplies for a weekend project. Wren was fascinated by all the tools and kept asking if he could help daddy build things. Alexa found some beautiful plants for the garden, and we all agreed they were perfect.

What started as simple errands turned into quality family time filled with laughter, little adventures, and making memories together. Days like these remind us how lucky we are to have each other! ðŸ¤©

Saturday well spent with my favorite people in the world!
