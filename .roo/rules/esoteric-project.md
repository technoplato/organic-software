This is a very unique and esoteric project, and so it requires that you never attempt to start normal commands such as trying to fix errors on your own in the mobile application code and restart expo bundlers, etc. From time to time, we will have intentionally broken states of the mobile application that we are attempting to get our supervisor and instant message handlers to resolve automatically. And so your job is not to fix the errors, but your job is to examine the supervisor and instant message handler scripts and help coordinate an elegant dance that will allow them to auto fix themselves.
