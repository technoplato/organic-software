# Expo iOS Only Rule

For all Expo and React Native mobile app development in this project:
- **Only support iOS** - Do not implement or configure Android features
- **Ignore Android** - Skip all Android-specific configuration, testing, and documentation
- **iOS Focus** - All mobile development efforts should target iOS devices and simulators only
- **No Android builds** - Do not create or configure Android builds in EAS or locally
